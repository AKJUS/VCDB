    "summary": "The incident was caused due to database misconfiguration in which FOX News exposed around 58 GB worth of data without any security authentication.  The IT security researchers at Website Planet headed by Jeremiah Fowler, have revealed details of a data leak affecting Fox News. Reportedly, the 58 GB data trove was left open with no password protection, making it convenient for anyone with an internet connection to access the exposed data.  According to Website Planet, a configuration error was responsible for exposing millions of Fox Newsâ€™ internal records, which included PII (personally identifiable information) of the company employees. The exposed database has since been secured.",
