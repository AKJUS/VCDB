    "summary": "A medical facility on standby to help test any coronavirus vaccine has been hit by a ransomware group that promised not to target medical organizations.  The criminals behind the Maze ransomware attacks have struck again, stealing data from a victim and then publishing it online to get them to pay the ransom demanded. That, in and of itself, would not be particularly newsworthy, sadly. However, the Maze threat actors were amongst the leading cybercrime gangs which, just days ago, pledged not to attack healthcare and medical targets. The Maze threat actors didn't go as far as those behind the DoppelPaymer threat by offering free decryptor codes to those hit by accident. Nor, it would appear, did they mean what they said. The latest victim is Hammersmith Medicines Research, a British company that previously tested the Ebola vaccine and is on standby to perform the medical trials on any COVID-19 vaccine. ",
