    "summary": "The National Social Insurance Fund (CNPS) of Cameroon has found itself at the center of a major cyberattack, with hackers releasing 10 GB of highly confidential data on the dark web.  The breach has sent shockwaves through the nation, raising serious concerns about the security of personal and financial data managed by public institutions.  Initially reported by Cameroon Concord earlier this month, the incident is believed to have been orchestrated by the notorious hacking group SpaceBears. The attack has been confirmed by multiple cybersecurity entities, including Ransomware.live, which monitors ransomware attacks globally.
