    "summary": "Toyota has confirmed that as many as 3.1 million items of Toyota and Lexus customer data may have been breached following an attack on dealerships in Japan.  The company says that \"information that may have been leaked this time does not include information on credit cards,\" but customers are already on edge following the cyber-attack that hit Toyota Australia in February.   Notification about the breach was published in the company newsroom last week. The statement said that there was \"unauthorized access on the network\" of a number of dealerships in the Tokyo area of Japan on March 21. Up to 3.1 million pieces of customer data, stored on a server connected to that network, may have been compromised as a result. ",
