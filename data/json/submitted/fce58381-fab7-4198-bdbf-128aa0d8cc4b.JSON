    "summary": "The president of the company that runs the Kappa Sushi restaurant chain is under investigation for allegedly obtaining trade secrets unlawfully from rival Hama-sushi Co. Tanabe is suspected of having received Hama-sushiâ€™s daily sales data and other corporate information through emails sent by a person associated with the rival firm. It allegedly occurred several times between last November, when Tanabe became an adviser to Kappa Create, and mid-December.  Tanabe previously worked at Zensho Holdings Co., the parent company of Hama-sushi, before joining Kappa Create. His former colleague at Zensho Holdings reportedly sent him the emails in question. ",
