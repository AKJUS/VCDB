The email addresses were shared when Serco was contacting new recruits about training.“An email was sent to new recruits who had given us their permission to use their personal email addresses,” a spokesperson for the company said. “In error, email addresses were visible to other recipients. We have apologised and reviewed our processes to make sure that this does not happen again.”",
