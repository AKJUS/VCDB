    "summary": "A data breach is affecting clients and families of the Achievement Center of LECOM Health (ACLH), according to a news release.   ACLH is currently working to notify people whose data may have been improperly accessed as a result of the breach.   An investigation was launched immediately after suspicious activity was observed in two ACLH business email accounts on March 2, according to ACLH officials. Third-party forensic specialists were brought in to determine the nature and scope of the activity.   The investigation found that there was unauthorized access to one ACLH email account from July 30, 2020 to August 3, 2020 and another account from February 25, 2021 to March 2, 2021.   ACLH officials are notifying identified client families that may have had personal information exposed as a result of the breach.   Potential data obtained from the email accounts includes demographic data, including name, address, date of birth, and/or social security number, clinical diagnosis, lab results, medication and/or other treatment information, and/or insurance information names, emails, and addresses. ACLH client families are urged to monitor account statements and remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud. Client families are urged to report any suspicious activity immediately to their insurance company, health care provider or financial institution.   ACLH has set up a website dedicated to providing more information about the breach. ",
