Attack affects approximately 2,385,646 individuals. On Dec 24, 2024, the hackers sent an email to victims: \"Integris Health (integrisok.com) was breached on November 2023. The data of over 2 million patients was compromised including SSN, DOB, Address, Phone, Insurance Information, and Employer Information.

We have contacted Integris Health, but they refuse to resolve this issue. We give you the opportunity to remove your personal data from our databases before we sell the entire database to data brokers on Jan 5 2024.” The email continues “A buyer can also purchase data without exclusive rights for 3$. In this case, the data will still be listed on the shop. You can remove your data from our shop and protect it from future fraud by purchasing exclusive rights on it (50$).\" INTEGRIS is offering one year of monitoring.",
