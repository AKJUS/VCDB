    "summary": "Ontario's information and privacy commissioner is investigating after a clear plastic bag containing documents with patient names and medication information was left at the curb outside a London walk-in clinic.   One patient whose information was in the bag said she's furious the papers weren't shredded.   \"I'm upset that they've done this,\" Jennifer Ebel told CBC News. \"You put responsibility on the medical profession to ensure your privacy is upheld and there are laws to state that they must be upheld. I would love to know why this happened.\"",
