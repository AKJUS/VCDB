    "summary": "A rest home worker who shared \"disgusting\" photos of dementia patients on social media has apologised for his \"silly mistake\".  The 21-year-old healthcare assistant has come under fire for taking selfies with two residents at the Awanui Rest Home in Auckland, and sharing them with friends on Snapchat.  The photos included captions such as \"sugar mummy\", and \"me and my sugar daddy today\". Another photo shows the woman from the first picture lying on a mattress, with the caption \"I'm straight up not having a good time.\"  The employee told the Herald he did not add the captions himself, his friends did. But he said he thought they were funny and shared them further with other close friends.",
