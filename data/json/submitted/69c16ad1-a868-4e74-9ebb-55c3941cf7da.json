    "summary": "A mobile application proposed to the government of the Netherlands as a means to track COVID-19 has already fallen short of acceptable security standards by leaking user data.  The app, Covid19 Alert, was one of seven applications presented to the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport, as reported by RTL Nieuws.   The shortlisted mobile app's source code was published online over the weekend for scrutiny as the government decides which solution to back. It was not long before developers realized that the source files contained user data -- originating from another application.   According to the publication, the app contained close to 200 full names, email addresses, and hashed user passwords stored in a database from another project linked to an Immotef developer. ",
