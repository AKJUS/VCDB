    "summary": "A May cyberattack against the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services could have exposed most Alaskans' personal and health information to the attackers, the department said Thursday.  \"It is a fair statement to say that any Alaskan could have been compromised by this,\" Health and Social Services Commissioner Adam Crum said.  Given the attack's scale, \"we cannot be assured there is a low probability that protected health information was compromised, and therefore, in accordance with (federal law), we are notifying Alaskans their health or personal information may have been compromised,\" the department said in a written statement.",
