    "summary": "Online education site EduCBA has started notifying customers that they are resetting their passwords after suffering a data breach.  EduCBA is an online education site based out of India that offers over 2,500 online courses and job oriented learning programs focus on finance, technology, and business to their 500,000 learners. Yesterday, EduCBA began emailing data breach notifications to customers stating that their systems were hacked and user data was exposed.  The notification is a bit strange as it does not go into great detail about what information was stolen and simply states, \"email, name, password, courses visited, etc may have been compromised.\"",
