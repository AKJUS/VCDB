    "summary": "A beer vendor was arrested Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium after using a Square reader to charge more than $700 to a fan's credit card during a Miami Dolphins game, police said.  Nathaniel Collier, 33, faces charges of third-degree grand theft and possession of a skimming device.  According to an arrest affidavit, the victim ordered two beers from Collier during Miami's 30-10 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers and gave him his credit card to pay for them. But police said Collier used his personal card reader to charge the victim $724.  The victim was notified of the charge by his bank a short time later.  Collier was taken into custody without incident. Police said he had a Square credit card reader in his possession.",
