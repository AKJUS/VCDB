It includes home addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, licence plates, and dates of birth, among other things, NOS reports based on its own research.   The broadcaster found the data for sale online and contacted the hacker offering it. According to the hacker, the set includes traceable data of at least 7.3 million people, but it is possible that the same person appears in the set more than once. RDC called 7.3 million affected people \"realistic\", according to NOS.",
