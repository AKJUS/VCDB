    "summary": "The Texas Department of Insurance recently disclosed a “data security event” that appears to have affected roughly 1.8 million people.  The exposed information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of births, and partial or full social security numbers, as well as information about injuries and worker compensation claims. TDI said it became aware of a security issue affecting one of its web applications on January 4. The affected app is used to manage workers’ compensation information.  “We found the issue was due to programming code that allowed internet access to a protected area of the application,” the organization said.  The application was temporarily shut down after the security flaw was discovered and it was brought back online after the issue was fixed.",
