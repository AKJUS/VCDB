    "summary": "What a week it must have been over at Mexican logistics startup, iVoy. When your users’ data has been potentially compromised, you have a lot to do.  Last Tuesday (28), news broke that it was among a series of companies to experience a data breach. In the process, a reported 127,432 account users’ emails and iVoy passwords were exposed on an online forum.  Putting things in perspective: If a person uses the same password for everything (tsk tsk), that means they’re vulnerable on multiple fronts (e.g. email, social media, e-commerce platforms) when that password is obtained by an unauthorized party.  The startup stated that it’s deployed all its security protocols and that “users’ personal data is safe.” But just in case, it advised them to change their passwords.",
