    "summary": "  A mailer sent to some Orlando voters features Mayor Buddy Dyer standing with a group of children, stating a vote for him will “help Orlando reach new heights.”  But what prompted concerns from some was on the backside: A request form for a vote-by-mail ballot, with the voter’s name, address, phone number and date of birth pre-filled out. The form also already had adhesive to seal it and a crease to fold and mail the form in.  After receiving complaints on Facebook about the information being displayed, the campaign said Tuesday it would limit the personal information it uses going forward.  “This common practice to help increase participation has raised privacy concerns with some residents,” said Jessica Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Dyer campaign. “Due to this feedback, we will limit the information we pre-fill in our outreach.”",
