    "summary": "enior living and care referral service provider A Place for Mom has won a preliminary injunction against a former employee who allegedly stole trade secrets and used proprietary information to solicit customers for a direct competitor.  Lisa Perkins was hired as a healthcare account executive in 2015, signing confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition contracts, according to the court document. She left the company in April, however, saying she was going to “care for her aging mother,” APFM said. The company said it later learned that Perkins left to work for Senior Living Specialists in Addison, TX, a direct competitor.  When APFM reviewed her work email, the company reportedly discovered that six weeks before she resigned, Perkins sent to her personal email account “highly sensitive company records and trade secrets” related to APFM’s customers, referral sources, training materials, and sales and marketing strategies.",
