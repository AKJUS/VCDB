    "summary": "A data breach occurred at the Richmond-based nonprofit that oversees organ transplantation in the U.S., exposing up to 1.2 million patient records.  The United Network for Organ Sharing says it is investigating an error that caused Social Security numbers, dates of birth and medical procedure information to be released.  The lapse comes two years after a government agency issued a report criticizing UNOSâ€™ technological capabilities, calling them out of date.  The breach did not affect the matching or allocation of organs to patients. UNOS oversees the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, a collection of 56 organ procurement organizations and 248 transplant hospitals that transplant kidneys, livers and other organs throughout the country.",
