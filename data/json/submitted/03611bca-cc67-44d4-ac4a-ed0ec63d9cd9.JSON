    "summary": "Piping Rock, a US-based producer of vitamins and dietary supplements, has allegedly been breached, with attackers accessing over 2.1 million emails.  An ad for the company’s data recently appeared on a well-known data leak forum. The culprit claims that the personal details of nearly a million customers lie within 2.1 million stolen emails.  The Cybernews research team has looked into the data sample that the attacker provided and concluded that the information appears to be legitimate.  We’ve reached out to Piping Rock for comment but did not receive a response before publishing.  The attacker claims to have obtained the personal details of 957,384 of the company’s customers, including:  Email addresses Names Phone numbers Home addresses Purchases The attacker’s post reads, “The management suddenly just stopped in the middle of negotiations,” implying that the hacker has been discussing the data theft with the company.",
