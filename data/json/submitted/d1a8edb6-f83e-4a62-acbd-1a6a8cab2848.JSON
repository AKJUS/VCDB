    "summary": "JPMorgan Chase says it has discovered a data breach affecting the personal information of nearly half a million customers.  New filings with the Office of the Maine Attorney General show the banking giant recently found a software issue that’s been active since August 26th, 2021.  The bug allowed unauthorized access to retirement plan records of 451,809 customers, which contain names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account numbers.  JPMorgan says it now fixed the issue, which erroneously gave full access to several “authorized system users” who were employed by JPMorgan customers or their agents.  The bank says it has no indication that the personal information has been misused, and it’s offering two years of free credit monitoring through Experian to affected customers.",
