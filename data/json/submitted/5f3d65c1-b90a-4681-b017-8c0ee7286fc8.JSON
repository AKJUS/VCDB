    "summary": "Indonesia’s tax agency has suffered a massive data breach that leaked the government-issued and personal information of 6 million taxpayers, including the country’s president, Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo, his close family members, and high-profile government officials.  - Advertisement - Boasting the largest archipelago and with a population of 275 million people, Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous country and the third-largest democracy since the fall of the authoritarian government in 1998.  However, the Southeast Asian nation grapples with numerous data breaches affecting over 280 government agencies, raising concerns about the country’s state of cybersecurity.  Publicized on X (formerly Twitter) the DJP data leak surfaced after a threat actor known as ‘Bjorka’ listed the stolen information for sale on a cybercrime marketplace BreachForums for $10,000,  equivalent to 150 million Rupiah in local currency.",
