    "summary": "Cardinal Contracting recently became aware of suspicious activity related to certain Cardinal Contracting email accounts. Cardinal Contracting immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity.  Cardinal Contracting's investigation determined that there was unauthorized access to certain email accounts from September 9, 2020 to December 8, 2020.
