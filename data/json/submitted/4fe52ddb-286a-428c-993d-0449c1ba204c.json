    "summary": "Researchers from Check Point and CyberInt. recently found a vulnerable risk in EA Origin, a gaming server that hosts millions of players online. The discovery shows that up to 300 million gamers had their personally identifiable information (PII) exposed on popular games such as Madden, Battlefield, FIFA, NBA Live, and more. The security hazard enables hackers to exploit gaming accounts without compromising login credentials. Researchers reported that they were able to take control of an EA subdomain, which was used to lure online players into thinking that it was a secure webpage. The page would then use embedded codes to steal access tokens for easy entry into online accounts.",
