Cabot Financial (Ireland) Ltd, Cookstown Court, Old Belgard Road, Tallaght, Dublin, claims there are “persons unknown” behind the attack along with a UK incorporated web hosting provider called Aeza International Ltd.  Last month, Cabot was granted an injunction requiring Aeza and the “persons unknown” to deliver up some 356 GB of data initially removed from Cabot’s IT system between September 17th and 18th last.  Cabot was also granted an anonymisation order and its initial application was heard in private (in camera) by Mr Justice Brian Cregan.",
