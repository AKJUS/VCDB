    "summary": "The NSS is a government program managing a mandatory year of public service for graduates of certain educational institutions in Ghana. Every year, thousands of students join the program from across the country to work in various public sectors, including healthcare.  The NSS was using Amazon Web Services to store over 3 million files from its programs. Despite password protecting some of the files in its cloud storage account, simple oversights by whoever created the account and uploaded and organized the files on the S3 bucket made this insufficient, and many files were still exposed.  As a result, up to 700,000 people from across Ghana were exposed to fraud, hacking, and identity theft â€“ not to mention the dangers posed to the institutions they were working at and the Ghanian government itself.
