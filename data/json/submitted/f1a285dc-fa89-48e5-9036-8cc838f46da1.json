    "summary": "On the eve of releasing its financial earnings for the past quarter, Honda created a situation described by one security researcher as “a hacker’s dream”. According to Verdict, 40GB of critical company data – amounting to 134m rows of system data – was stored on an unsecured Elasticsearch database.  This meant that anyone who knew where to look could have come across the company’s most sensitive data, not only including information about the company’s security systems and networks, but also technical data on all of its IP addresses, operating systems and what patches they had.",
