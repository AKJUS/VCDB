Between 2015 and 2017, the two physicians allegedly wrote 1,009 fraudulent prescriptions for oxycodone and Xanax, totaling 99,753 pills with a street value of nearly $2 million, under the names of more than 100 tenants living in the three properties. The scheme cost Medicaid nearly $30,500, officials said.",
