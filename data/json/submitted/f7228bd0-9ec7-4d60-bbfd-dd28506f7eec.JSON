    "summary": "Bailey Cavalieri’s filing with the Attorney General of Maine provides some important information on what led up to the breach. According to this source, on December 13, 2022, Bailey Cavalieri detected suspicious activity within its computer network. In response, Bailey Cavalieri engaged outside forensic and data security specialists to investigate the incident.  The Bailey Cavalieri investigation confirmed that an unauthorized party was able to access the company’s computer network between November 22, 2022 and December 13, 2022. It was later determined that some of the files that were accessible to the unauthorized party contained confidential consumer information.  After learning that sensitive consumer data was accessible to an unauthorized party, Bailey Cavalieri reviewed the compromised files to determine what information was leaked and which consumers were impacted. While the breached information varies depending on the individual, it may include your name, Social Security number, driver’s license or state identification number, date of birth, payment card information, financial account information, health insurance and medical information, taxpayer identification number, system access login credentials, and passport number.  On August 17, 2023, Bailey Cavalieri sent out data breach letters to anyone who was affected by the recent data security incident. These letters should provide victims with a list of what information belonging to them was compromised.",
