    "summary": "The second attack, far more insidious, involves the Brno University Hospital in the city of Brno in the Czech Republic. The second biggest hospital in the country, the ransomware was detected March 14 and caused computers across the hospital to shut down delaying surgery and coronavirus test results.  The form of attack was not immediately clear, but reports noted that files were unable to be accessed, suggesting that they had been encrypted in a ransomware attack.",
