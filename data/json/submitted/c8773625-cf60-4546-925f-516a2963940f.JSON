VillageHealth1 operates on behalf of health plans to coordinate care for members who have certain clinical conditions.

The PracticeMax network experienced an information security event during which it was subject to unauthorized access, beginning on April 17, 2021 and ending on May 5, 2021. On May 1, 2021, upon discovery of the incident, PracticeMax immediately initiated a review of the incident, engaged legal counsel and began working with a security forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation. On August 19, 2021, PracticeMax notified VillageHealth that it had determined which VillageHealth patients’ personal information may have been accessed by an unauthorized party, and that this access may have occurred between April 17, 2021 and May 5, 2021.
