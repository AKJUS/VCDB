    "summary": "According to the TD Bank spokesperson, a fraud case impacted two retailer customers in Vermont, and the issue has been resolved.   The story we wrote on Oct. 3 was based on BleepingComputer's report, which is now taken down. TD representative shared the statement on behalf of TD Bank. \"At TD Bank, protecting the security of our customers' accounts is a top priority and we take the issue of fraud very seriously. The letter posted by Office of the Vermont Attorney General on Sept. 28, 2022 was a communication that TD sent recently to two retail customers in Vermont. As the letter stated, a TD employee improperly accessed some of their account information. Our investigation determined this was an isolated incident. The employee was terminated as a result of the investigation findings. The two customers were fully reimbursed and we offered free credit monitoring to them. At TD, we require colleagues to meet high standards of ethics, integrity, and professionalism. To protect our customers and the bank, TD has strong processes in place to identify, investigate and deter potential fraud.\" TD Bank has announced that there has been a leak of customer information that has been stolen by a former employee. The personal information that has been acquired by the said employee includes the user's full name, physical address, social security number, safe of birth, transactional information, and account number.  The Vermont Attorney General's office has received the data breach notification stating that one of TD Bank's former employees has been giving away the information to a third-party outside of bank personnel, as mentioned in BleepingComputer.  TD Bank has since issued a clarification regarding the reported data breach, saying that the notification issued by the Attorney General's office in Vermont pertains to a fraud case that has impacted only two customers. The issue has already been resolved by the bank. ",
