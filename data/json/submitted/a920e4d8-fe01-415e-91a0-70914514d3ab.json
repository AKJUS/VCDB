    "summary": "Hacktivist collective Anonymous claims to have obtained gigabytes of data from Epik, which provides domain name, hosting, and DNS services for a variety of clients. These include the Texas GOP, Gab, Parler, and 8chan, among other right-wing sites. The stolen data has been released as a torrent. The hacktivist collective says that the data set, which is over 180GB in size, contains a “decade’s worth of data from the company.”  Anonymous says the data set is “all that’s needed to trace actual ownership and management of the fascist side of the Internet that has eluded researchers, activists, and, well, just about everybody.” Epik has now confirmed that an \"unauthorized intrusion\" did in fact occur into its systems. The announcement follows last week's incident of hacktivist collective Anonymous leaking 180 GB of data stolen from online service provider Epik. To mock the company's initial response to the data breach claims, Anonymous had altered Epik's official knowledge base, as reported by Ars.  Epik is a domain registrar and web services provider known to serve right-wing clients, some of which have been turned down by more mainstream IT providers due to the objectionable and sometimes illicit content hosted by the clients. Epik's clients have included the Texas GOP, Parler, Gab, and 8chan, among others.  Epik hack impacts millions of non-customers, too Turns out, the leaked data dump contains 15,003,961 email addresses belonging to both Epik's customers and non-customers, and not everyone is pleased with the news. This occurred as Epik had scraped WHOIS records of domains, even those not owned by the company, and stored these records. In doing so, the contact information of those who have never transacted with Epik directly was also retained in Epik's systems.  FURTHER READING Anonymous leaks gigabytes of data from alt-right web host Epik Data breach monitoring service HaveIBeenPwned has now begun sending out alerts to their subscribers whose email addresses were exposed in the Epik hack. The service's founder, Troy Hunt, is one of the many impacted by the data breach but who \"had absolutely nothing to do with Epik.\"  In a poll last week, Hunt had asked if affected users who weren't Epik customers preferred receiving breach alerts as well. The majority of users responded affirmatively to the question.",
