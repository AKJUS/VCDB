    "summary": "Huddle House has become the latest US restaurant chain to suffer a Point of Sale (POS)-related data breach.  The casual dining and fast food operation revealed on Friday that a malware intrusion had affected an unspecified number of its “corporate and franchised locations.  “Criminals compromised a third-party POS vendor’s data system and utilized the vendor’s assistance tools to gain remote access — and the ability to deploy malware — to some Huddle House corporate and franchisee POS systems,” it said in a notice.  “Huddle House was notified by a law enforcement agency and its credit card processor that some of its corporate and franchise locations may have been victims of a malicious cyber-attack. Huddle House retained a leading IT investigation and security firm in less than 24 hours from notification, to deploy specialized software to prevent further attacks.”",
