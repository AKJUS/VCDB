    "summary": " On November 10th, 2023, Hackread.com exclusively reported that threat actors had disclosed a scraped database containing information from Chess.com users. The database, containing approximately 828,327 users, was leaked on the notorious Breach Forums.  Over the weekend, a different threat actor leaked another scraped database from Chess.com, affecting nearly 500,000 (476,121) users of the widely used online platform for chess enthusiasts and social networking.  Interestingly, this forum also saw another threat actor leaking a scraped database from LinkedIn just a couple of days prior on the same forum, which contained information from 25 million users.  Similar to the previous data breach, the latest incident also involves the exposure of sensitive information. The compromised data includes full names, usernames, profile links, email addresses, usersâ€™ originating countries, avatar URLs (profile pictures), Universal Unique Identifier (UUID), user IDs, and registration dates.",
