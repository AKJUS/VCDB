While affirming that there’s no indication of an ongoing security threat, the company is actively addressing the situation after reports surfaced suggesting that sensitive personal information of approximately 1.5 million individuals might have been compromised earlier this month.  IHCL’s Response and Assurance In a statement issued by an IHCL spokesperson, the company acknowledged being made aware of claims regarding possession of a limited customer dataset that supposedly contains non-sensitive information. Emphasizing the paramount importance of safeguarding customer data, the spokesperson assured that investigations into the claim are underway. “We have notified the relevant authorities and continue to monitor our systems with no suggestion of any existing security threat impacting our business operations,” the spokesperson added.  ALSO READ: India Ranks Third Globally in Governmental Requests for Content Removal from Google  The Ransom Demand and Hacker’s Conditions The alleged threat stems from a group or individual identifying as ‘Dnacookies,’ who reportedly seeks $5,000 in exchange for the complete dataset. The compromised information reportedly includes addresses, membership IDs, mobile numbers, and other personally identifiable details spanning from 2014 to 2020. According to sources familiar with the matter, ‘Dnacookies’ has established three conditions for any potential deal:  A designated negotiator, preferably a forum administrator, must facilitate the agreement. The data must be purchased in its entirety, with no option for partial acquisition. No further samples of the compromised data will be provided. Legal Implications and Government Response The breach, if confirmed, may lead to significant legal repercussions under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act. This legislation mandates penalties of up to Rs 250 crore for individual instances of data breaches and a staggering maximum penalty of Rs 500 crore for multiple breaches by a single entity or business (termed data fiduciaries).  Breach Details Revealed on Cybercrime Marketplace The breach details surfaced publicly on November 5 via a post on the dark web cybercrime platform, BreachForums. Within this posting, the threat actor ‘Dnacookies’ provided a sample dataset containing 1,000 unique entries, possibly showcasing the extent of the compromised information.",
