    "summary": "The Wall Street Journal reports that the CEO of an unnamed UK-based energy company thought he was talking on the phone with his boss, the CEO of the German parent company, who'd asked him to urgently transfer â‚¬220,000 ($243,000) to a Hungarian supplier. However, the UK CEO was in fact taking instructions from a scammer who'd used AI-powered voice technology to impersonate the German CEO. It's the voice equivalent of deepfake videos that are causing alarm for their potential to manipulate public opinion and cause social discord.    The voice fraud incident was described to the WSJ by the energy company's insurer, Euler Hermes Group.   The insurer believes the scammer had used commercially available AI voice-generating software to carry out the fraud. ",
