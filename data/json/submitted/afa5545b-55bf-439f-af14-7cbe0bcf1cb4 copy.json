    "summary": "On March 27, 2020, our system was impacted by a ransomware event that encrypted certain files. Upon learning of the situation, we promptly investigated the incident with the help of a leading cybersecurity firm and have taken steps to prevent any recurrence. We also notified law enforcement and are cooperating with its investigation. In the course of our investigation, we learned that some files were copied from our system in connection with the attack. We reviewed the contents of all files that may have been acquired. What Information Was Involved? On or around June 10, 2020, we determined that a limited number of documents that may have been acquired contained some personal information, including your name, date of birth, and Social Security number. We then worked diligently to locate additional, necessary information for mailing, which was completed on June 30, 2020",
