    "summary": "AMMAN - The government on Friday referred the third case related to a leak of official documents within two weeks to the Public Security Department’s Cyber Crimes Unit to take necessary legal action against public servants involved in the case.  The move is based on a recommendation of Minister of State for Prime Ministry Affairs Sami Daoud, who reaffirmed that this procedure is implemented in light of the growing number of cases of leaked records, which violate legislation in force and the privacy of persons.  The minister vowed “zero-tolerance” against anyone who tries to leak official documents, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.",
