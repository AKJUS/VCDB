    "summary": "The College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) has been dealing with a \"cybersecurity incident\" that may have compromised the personal information of its almost 200,000 members, CBC News has learned.   The name of the college and some of the information hackers say they have access to appears on a website associated with ransomware attacks. The information appears near a \"secret data publication\" countdown clock, which appears to give the college just over 12 days to respond to whatever demands the attackers have made.   The hack was discovered Sept. 8, but the college did not tell its members about it until this morning when it posted a statement on its website after being contacted by CBC News.   The CNO has not responded to specific questions about the attack. ",
