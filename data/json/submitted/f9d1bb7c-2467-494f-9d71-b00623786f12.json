    "summary": "A temporary frontline worker stands accused of stealing an engagement ring from a patient at an assisted living facility in Denver, Colo., who died of COVID-19. Prosecutors said Elizabeth Daniels, 29, also used the woman’s credit card to purchase a vehicle the day the woman passed away.  Daniels faces charges of theft from an at-risk victim over $500, identity theft, providing a false statement to a pawnbroker and criminal possession of a financial transaction device.  Prosecutors said Daniels pawned the engagement ring belonging to Barbara Gust, 86, who lived in the memory care wing at Carillon at Belleview Station, “an upscale senior living community offering a continuum of care services including independent living, assisted living and memory care.”",
