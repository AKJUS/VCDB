    "summary": "Internet Archive data breach, defacement, and DDoS: Users’ data compromised  The Internet Archive has suffered a data breach, leading to the compromise of email addresses, screen names and bcrypt password hashes of some 31 million users.  The compromise was revealed on Wednesday afternoon, when the digital library’s website began showing a JavaScript pop-up saying: “Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!”  Around the same time, the data in question was being loaded into the Have I Been Pwned? data breach notification service and, soon after, HIBP users who signed up for notifications when their data is leaked began receiving notices via email",
