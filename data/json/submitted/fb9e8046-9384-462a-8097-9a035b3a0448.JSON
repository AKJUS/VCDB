    "summary": "Patients of anesthesia medical practices affiliated with Somnia Inc. have filed four class action lawsuits accusing the Harrison medical management company of negligence in a massive data breach.  Five individuals from California and Texas filed the complaints in U.S. District Court in White Plains from Oct. 31 through Nov. 8, on behalf of more than 400,000 people whose personal records were compromised.  Investigators found that some patient information “may have been compromised,” the notice states, including names, social security numbers, health insurance numbers, and diagnoses and treatments.  Somnia says its medical “entities” were notified to contact their patients. Later, the company sent letters to the patients with more information about the breach and instructions on enrolling in free credit monitoring services. ",
