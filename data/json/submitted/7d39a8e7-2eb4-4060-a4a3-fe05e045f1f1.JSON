    "summary": "More than half a million patients have been impacted by a data breach at US healthcare provider Texas Ear, Nose and Throat Specialists (Texas ENT).  After learning of a security compromise on October 19, Texas ENT “determined that unauthorized parties gained access to our computer systems and took copies of Texas ENT files between August 9, 2021 and August 15, 2021”, reads a security alert (PDF) from the healthcare specialist.  The breached data includes patient names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, procedure codes used for billing purposes, and, for only “a limited number of files”, Social Security numbers.  The unauthorized intruders did not access the company’s electronic medical records system, Texas ENT stressed.  Texas ENT notified the US Department of Health and Human Services on December 10  that 535,489 individuals were potentially impacted by the breach, which makes it the biggest data breach reported to the agency in December so far.",
