    "summary": "Ransomware name and shame on healthcare company during pandemic.  Magellan Health is warning customers that an April 11 ransomware attack may have affected their personal information.  A Mandiant investigation determined an “unauthorized actor gained access to Magellan’s systems after sending a phishing email on April 6” impersonating one of the company’s clients, the company said in a notice from Magellan Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer John J. DiBernardi. Before launching ransomware the third party “exfiltrated a subset of data” from one of Magellan’s corporate servers that contained customer PII, including names, addresses, employee ID numbers and W-2 or 1099 details such as Social Security numbers or Taxpayer ID numbers. “In limited instances, and only with respect to certain current employees, the unauthorized actor also used a piece of malware designed to steal login credentials and passwords.” ",
