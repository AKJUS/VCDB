    "summary": "OpenSubtitles, a website providing free movie subtitles, confirmed to its users this month that it had been hacked last August and that the hacker had demanded a ransom to remain silent about the attack and to delete the leaked data. The site owner reports that he paid the ransom, but the stolen dataset has now surfaced and it appears that it could be circulating on some underground forums.  The OpenSubtitles data breach affects 6,783,158 users of the platform and includes personally identifiable data such as email and IP addresses, usernames, user's geolocation and passwords stored as unsalted MD5 hashes",
