    "summary": "lients' personal information was taken from servers used by Brandywine Counseling and Community Services, the organization announced Friday. It has begun sending letters to affected clients.   After discovering some servers were infected with ransomware on Feb. 10, BCCS took steps to secure its network while contacting law enforcement and starting an investigation, it said in a release.  The organization said personal information taken included clients’ names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and treatment information.   The ransomware incident did not affect all clients, BCCS said, and letters are being mailed to those whose information was compromised as a precaution.  BCCS is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services to clients whose Social Security numbers or driver’s license numbers were taken.  They recommended that clients check any statements from health care providers and insurers, to make sure there are no charges for services they didn't receive. ",
