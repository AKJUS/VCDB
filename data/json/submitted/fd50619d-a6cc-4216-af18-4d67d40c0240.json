    "summary": "The four casino workers generated false “coin-in” amounts on the electronic gaming machines, including video slots, which resulted in “fraudulent” credit vouchers for the same totals, the indictment says.  Mechanically, the four workers connected one end of a wire to a device inside a gaming machine “that would recognize coins.” They then connected the other end of the wire to another metal surface inside the cabinet that would cause the machine to generate the coin-in amounts.  To erase their tracks, the indictment says, they “conducted a ‘hard reset’ or ‘RAM clear’ of the [gaming machine], which would delete the history of the false and fraudulent ‘coin-in’ amounts from the [machine].”  The total take was $5.3 million, according to federal prosecutor Dwayne Williams. The alleged computer fraud scheme lasted from Jan. 29, 2011 to May 27, 2015.  All eight of the defendants committed money laundering by taking the stolen casino funds and buying real estate, investment properties, vehicles and college savings plans in Florida, the indictment says.
