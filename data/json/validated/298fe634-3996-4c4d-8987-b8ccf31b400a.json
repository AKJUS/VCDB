    "summary": "Microsoft disclosed today a security breach that took place last month in December 2019.  In a blog post today, the OS maker said that an internal customer support database that was storing anonymized user analytics was accidentally exposed online without proper protections between Dec.r 5 and Dec. 31.  The database was spotted and reported to Microsoft by Bob Diachenko, a security researcher with Security Discovery.  The leaky customer support database consisted of a cluster of five Elasticsearch servers, a technology used to simplify search operations, Diachenko told ZDNet today. All five servers stored the same data, appearing to be mirrors of each other.  Diachenko said Microsoft secured the exposed database on the same day he reported the issue to the OS maker, despite being New Year's Eve.  \"I have been in touch with the Microsoft team helping and supporting them to properly investigate it,\" Diachenko told ZDNet.",
